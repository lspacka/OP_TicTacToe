each player == obj
GameBoard == ?
GameState == obj

where to check for the winner? i.e how to handle the loop of the game

- before each play GameState prompts the player
- on each play GameState pushes the play to the board array inside GameBoard
  (Im in a pickle with this one. have a crude workaround with a history array, but it's really ugly...)
- after each play GameState calls GameBoard factory(?) and shows (returns) the (current) board
