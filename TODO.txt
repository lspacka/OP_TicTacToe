Players == obj
GameBoard == ?
GameState == obj

where to check for the winner? i.e how to handle the loop of the game
LOOP:
  1. prompt the player
  2. check for winner
  3. if (winner) escape loop, show the winner. reset game
  4. else go back to 1

- keep track of the current play ('X' or 'O')
- before each play GameState prompts the player
  + validate input (row, col) with regex
- on each play GameState pushes the play to the board array inside GameBoard
  + extract row and col from the input string
  + put the current play on the board array
+ after each play GameState calls GameBoard factory(?) and shows (returns) the (current) board
