where to check for the winner? i.e how to handle the loop of the game
LOOP:
  1. prompt the player
  2. check for winner and a move already in place
  3. check next play
  4. if (winner) escape loop, show the winner. reset game
  5. else, place play on board. go back to 1

+ keep track of the current play ('X' or 'O')
+ before each play GameState prompts the player
  + validate input (row, col) with regex
+ on each play GameState pushes the play to the board array inside GameBoard
  + extract row and col from the input string
  + put the current play on the board array
+ after each play GameState calls GameBoard factory(?) and shows (returns) the (current) board
+ have checkWin() exclude all the '-' 

+ restart game without reloading the page 3hrs
- check if theres a move in place 2hrs
